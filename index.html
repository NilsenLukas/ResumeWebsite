          <hr />
          <p>
            Hello! I'm a computer science enthusiast at the University of
            Detroit Mercy, where I'm blending a rigorous academic curriculum
            with a minor in Leadership. My ambition is to secure a summer
            internship that will allow me to sharpen my skills in C++, Java, and
            Python. I thrive on collaboration and have a proven track record of
            quickly mastering new concepts—a trait I demonstrated during my
            internship at General Dynamics Land Systems and as a key player in a
            high-stakes kitchen environment.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            On the field, as a dedicated member of the Division One Men’s
            Lacrosse Program, I've cultivated resilience and strategic prowess.
            Off the field, I channel my energy into mentoring future talent
            through coaching. I'm eager to bring my blend of technical
            knowledge, leadership, and adaptability to an innovative team this
            summer.
