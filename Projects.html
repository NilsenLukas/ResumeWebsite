            <p>
              This project showcases my personal portfolio website, designed and
              developed as a comprehensive platform to highlight my skills,
              experience, and projects. The website features a clean,
              user-friendly interface with a modern aesthetic that aligns with
              professional standards. It serves as a digital footprint of my
              journey in computer science, displaying various projects ranging
              from software applications to technical writings. By integrating
              responsive design principles, the site ensures an optimal viewing
              experience across various devices and screen sizes.

            <h3>Housing Price Prediction</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, I employed Python to develop a machine learning
              model aimed at predicting house prices. The model uses a dataset,
              analyzing various house features and details to estimate their
              market value accurately. Key techniques used include linear
              regression and RandomForest algorithms. Additionally, I enhanced
              the model's precision by implementing feature engineering and
              applying attribute weighting to give more importance to factors
              that significantly impact house price predictions. This project
              shows my ability to use advanced machine learning tools and
              statistical methods to extract valuable insights from complex
              datasets.
